# MovieMatchV2

This project is my capstone project for the Software Development AEC at Vanier College in Montreal. I will be creating a dating app style Movie Matching Android application, using swipeable cards and matching to another user. I am hoping to integrate third party login, with Google and Meta, as well as a chat function and a review function. The API that I am using is called Streaming Availability by Movie of the Night and allows for many different services from over 60 countries. The first 3 services that I will aim for will be Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ as those are the three that I have and will make testing easier.

*** Week 1 (June 27 – Jul 3) ***  
As I am doing this retroactively and forgot to save my earlier iterations of the README file, I will attempt to recreate each week from the start. I created my proposal this week and while waiting for approval, I started looking at a wireframe for a DFD and which UML diagrams that I would need to complete for the project. I used draw.io as I am most comfortable with this and will continue to do so as I move forward. After approval, I moved ahead on the Project Planning and Analysis document which helped me to assess the size and complexity of the project. Please refer to the document for a more detailed version of the project. It was in this document that I decided on most of the diagrams and ideas behind the project.

*** Week 2 (Jul 4 – Jul 10) ***
This week, I moved into some of the coding and diagrams. I was able to implement the Firebase Database and set up the Login and Registration. I started with a library and tutorial on how to create the swipeable card interface but once I implemented the API call, I ran into a ton of issues with integration. As such near the end of the week, I moved onto a different approach and was able to create the interface that I was looking for. I also had to recreate a different repository as I ran into an error after trying to merge my work. 

*** Week 3 (Jul 11 - Jul 17) ***
At the start of this week, I have been able to move into a new GitHub repo and will be using this one. During the troubleshooting from last week, I believe that I have learned enough to not run into anymore issues and if I do, I will reach out before deleting and starting again. I didn’t realize that I would be using it to track hours worked…although it makes sense. This week’s plan is to create more documentation for the next steps, which is saving swipes to database for matching, creating a host lobby and a join button, OTP creation and sharing as well as the third-party logins. I have worked on the UI/UX as well as some of the required menus during the weekend so as to not be overwhelmed when it comes time to put all of this together.
